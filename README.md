# boggle solver

Searches for all words in a simple Boggle board UI and outputs known words. 

Things i would implement given more time:
- Support for 'qu'
- Adjustable grid size in client
- Provide a better dictionary, maybe pull from an online resource
- Ability to play Boggle and compare with words that could have been found
- Display of found word paths in UI (for debugging or curiosity of user)
